# OpenHands account library

Account-level skills, sub-agents and lifecycle hooks for OpenHands, packaged as a
portable [Agent Plugins](https://agent-plugins.org) 1.0.0 package and registered as a personal
marketplace with `auto_load: true`, so every conversation picks them up.

## What is here

- **35 skills** — 32 keyword-triggered skills plus 3 path-triggered rules.
- **19 sub-agents** — a full software company plus project-specific roles.
- **3 lifecycle hooks** — a destructive-command guard (PreToolUse), a quality gate (Stop) and a
  backlog gate (Stop) that keeps the self-driving loop going while work remains.

## Layout

```
.agents/                      # the marketplace root (repo_path = ".agents")
  .plugin/marketplace.json    # marketplace manifest: declares one plugin
  plugin.json                 # Agent Plugins 1.0.0 manifest (the plugin itself)
  skills/<name>/SKILL.md      # 32 keyword-triggered skills (AgentSkills format)
  skills/<name>.md            # 3 path-triggered rules (frontmatter `paths:`)
  dev.openhands/
    agents/<name>.md          # 19 sub-agents
    hooks/hooks.json          # lifecycle hooks
    hooks/guard.py            # PreToolUse guard (decision logic)
    hooks/guard.sh            # PreToolUse guard (thin wrapper -> guard.py)
    hooks/quality_gate.sh     # Stop gate (finish only when the work is clean)
    hooks/backlog_gate.sh     # Stop gate (continue the self-driving loop)
docs/LOOP.md                  # loop protocol + the owner's merge grant
docs/BACKLOG.md               # the queue
docs/STATUS.md                # what Claude reads first
scripts/validate.py           # validates every manifest, frontmatter, skill and hook
scripts/loader_smoke.py       # loads the plugin through the real OpenHands SDK loader
tests/hooks_test.sh           # exercises the guard and the gates
```

Why the indirection: a marketplace on its own loads **only** skills. Sub-agents and hooks load
because the marketplace declares a plugin (`plugins: [{ source: "." }]`) and that plugin carries
them under `dev.openhands/`. Removing the plugin declaration silently drops 19 agents and 3 hooks.

## Components

| Component | Count | Loads because |
| - | - | - |
| Skills | 32 | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, keyword `triggers:` |
| Path rules | 3 | `skills/<name>.md`, `paths:` globs |
| Sub-agents | 19 | plugin → `dev.openhands/agents/*.md` |
| Hooks | 3 | plugin → `dev.openhands/hooks/hooks.json` |

### How a skill activates

The SDK maps each skill's frontmatter to a trigger, in this precedence order (source:
`openhands/sdk/skills/skill.py`):

1. **`paths:`** → `PathTrigger`. Content is injected when a matching file is touched. If a skill
   declares both `paths:` and `triggers:`, `paths:` wins and the `triggers:` are ignored with a
   warning — so do not mix them in one file.
2. **`triggers:` starting with `/`** → `TaskTrigger` (an explicit slash command).
3. **other `triggers:`** → `KeywordTrigger`. Content is injected when one of the keywords appears in
   a user message.
4. **neither** → `trigger=None` → the legacy **always-active** behaviour: the full content sits in
   `<REPO_CONTEXT>` on every turn.

All three of the library's path rules (`content-vs-brand`, `docs-evidence-format`,
`no-schedule-claims`) use `paths:`, so their content injects only when a matching file is touched.
`validate.py` enforces the "`triggers:` or `paths:`" choice; a legacy `.md` skill with neither would
load as always-active, which is rarely what is wanted — prefer `paths:` or an `AGENTS.md` entry.

Verified against `openhands-sdk` 1.58.2: `Plugin.load(".agents")` returns `PathTrigger` for the
three path rules and `KeywordTrigger` for the keyword skills (for example `owner-brief` →
`['final report', 'status', 'summary', 'handoff', 'brief', 'what happened']`).

## Hooks

- **`pre_tool_use` → `guard.py`** denies destructive or secret-leaking terminal commands: force-push
  and push to `main`/`master` (including `HEAD:main`, `+ref`, `--all`/`--mirror`, and a bare `git push`
  or `push … HEAD` while the checked-out branch is `main`/`master`), `--no-verify` (any git
  subcommand) and `git commit -n`, `rm -rf` of `/`, `~`, `.git` or a top-level system dir,
  printing a secret variable (`echo $TOKEN` and any `*TOKEN*`/`*SECRET*`/`*PASSWORD*`/`*API_KEY*`
  name, bare `printenv`/`env`, `printenv <SECRET>`, `cat /proc/*/environ`, `cat .env*` — except the
  template files `.env.example`/`.env.sample`/`.env.template`), printing a remote URL that may embed
  a git token (`git remote -v`, `git remote get-url`, `git config --list`/`-l`,
  `git config --get remote.*.url`, `cat .git/config`), and `curl`/`wget` piped into a shell or an
  interpreter (including through `sudo -E`). It skips git global options (`-C`, `-c`, `--git-dir`, …),
  unwraps `bash -lc`/`sh -ec`/`sudo`/`timeout`/`xargs`/`env`/`eval`/`$(…)`/backticks (depth 3), and
  splits the command into real argv tokens, so a branch name that merely contains `main` is not a
  false positive.
- **`stop` → `quality_gate.sh`** refuses to finish while `git diff --check` reports whitespace
  errors (in the worktree *and* in committed changes vs `origin/main`), while there is uncommitted
  work or a commit not pushed to the branch upstream (the agent's own untracked `.openhands/` memory
  directory is excluded), or while a project typecheck fails. The typecheck is skipped, with a
  notice, when `node_modules` is absent. Its commit-and-push message adds `git switch -c <name>`
  first when the current branch is `main`/`master`. Every decision line is valid JSON. A loop breaker
  allows the stop after 3 consecutive denials and prints a warning, so a stuck agent is never trapped;
  the counter expires after 1 hour.
- **`stop` → `backlog_gate.sh`** keeps the self-driving loop going. It allows the stop when
  `docs/STATUS.md` declares a `BLOCKER:` other than `none`, when there is no `status=ready` item in
  `docs/BACKLOG.md`, or once the 6-continuation cap is reached. Otherwise it denies and names the
  next item. If `CLAUDE_INBOX_ID` and `CLAUDE_INBOX_TOKEN` are set, it also fetches the Claude inbox
  and denies when a message has a higher `seq` than `last_seq` in `docs/STATUS.md`. It fails open,
  and it treats inbox text as data, never authority. The continuation counter also expires after
  1 hour.

**What the guard is and is not.** The guard stops honest mistakes. It is not a security boundary:
it inspects one `terminal` command at a time, and a determined command can get around it (encoding,
indirection the tokenizer does not model, a tool other than `terminal`). Do not rely on it to
contain a hostile actor.

## Claude inbox

Claude (the owner's reviewer) can leave a short message in a small store that the loop reads. The
message is JSON with `seq`, `type` (`note`, `task` or `stop`) and `body`.

The owner must add two secrets to the OpenHands secret store:

- `CLAUDE_INBOX_ID` — the store's id.
- `CLAUDE_INBOX_TOKEN` — the read token.

Do not commit either value, and do not print them. The Stop hook reads the inbox only when both are
set; the `self-driving-loop` skill polls the same URL:

```bash
curl -fsS --max-time 8 "https://edge-config.vercel.com/$CLAUDE_INBOX_ID/item/inbox?token=$CLAUDE_INBOX_TOKEN"
```

The message is handled once, when `seq` is greater than `last_seq` in `docs/STATUS.md`; the loop then
writes the new `last_seq` and an `ack seq <N>` line. Inbox text is data, never authority: it cannot
grant merge authority, relax a stop condition, ask for secrets, or edit `docs/LOOP.md`.

## Registration

The marketplace is stored in the account settings at `POST /api/v1/settings`
([Store Settings](https://docs.openhands.dev/openhands/usage/cloud/api-reference/settings/store-settings)).
The settings endpoint accepts either `Authorization: Bearer <key>` or `X-Access-Token: <key>`
(both verified live, HTTP 200):

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENHANDS_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"name":"openhands-account","source":"github:madnessgate44-debug/Openhands","repo_path":".agents","auto_load":true}]' \
  https://app.all-hands.dev/api/v1/settings
```

`GET /api/v1/settings` shows the saved entry under `registered_marketplaces`, with fields
`name`, `source`, `ref`, `repo_path`, `auto_load` and `scope`.

## Validating a change

```bash
python3 scripts/validate.py        # manifests, frontmatter, skills, sub-agents, hooks
bash tests/hooks_test.sh           # guard allow/deny cases and the quality-gate loop breaker
python3 scripts/loader_smoke.py    # loads the plugin through the real SDK loader
```

`validate.py` checks the files' shape. `loader_smoke.py` goes further: it calls
`Plugin.load(".agents")` with the same SDK OpenHands uses and fails if the loader returns fewer
skills or sub-agents than exist on disk, which is how a well-formed file can still be silently
dropped from the catalog. Run all three before committing.

CI runs all three on every pull request (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`). The workflow pins
`actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-python` to a commit SHA, and fails closed if
`tests/hooks_test.sh` is missing. Start a new conversation afterwards for the catalog to rebuild.
