BLOCKER: none
last_seq: 3
ack seq 3

**Owner brief**
- BLOCKER: none.
- Changed: (1) merged the pending LOW-risk status PR #123 (docs-only) under the `docs/LOOP.md` grant. (2) worked BL-5: fixed the quality gate so a pushed feature branch is no longer reported as unpushed — PR #125 open, HIGH, draft, not merged.
- Evidence: 12 Verified, 0 Observed-not-verified, 0 Blocked.
- Costs / irreversible steps: none.
- Next action for the owner: decide on two HIGH-risk PRs — #42 (watchdog workflow) and #125 (quality-gate fix); I will not merge either without you.
- Run 2026-11-08 (eighty-fourth): merged pending LOW-risk status PR #123 (head `3f67767bc512`); worked BL-5 -> PR #125 (head `759c9af`); no new inbox seq (seq 3 = `last_seq`).

Details
- Inbox: read succeeded; the store returned `seq: 3`, `type: task`, equal to `last_seq` 3, so it was already handled (BL-4). No ack changed; the two variables were never printed.
- Open PRs at run start: #123 (LOW risk, `docs/STATUS.md` only, CI green, the pending status PR from the previous run) and #42 (watchdog, HIGH risk, `.github/**` protected). #123 was a draft; marked ready (`gh pr ready 123`), then merged this run.
- Verified: PR #123 head `3f67767bc512`, `validate` check `success`, `mergeable_state: clean`, files = `docs/STATUS.md` only; merge-async returned `pending` then status `merged`, squash commit `f8bb0ca3acde`.
- BL-5 (worked this run): the Stop-hook gate (`quality_gate.sh`) false-positived "N commit(s) not pushed" on feature branches because the sandbox's `remote.origin.fetch` is narrow (`+refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/main`), so `@{u}` fails and the gate fell back to `origin/main..HEAD`. Fix: resolve the remote branch via `git ls-remote origin refs/heads/<branch>` (10s timeout) and compare against it; never-pushed still denies, unreachable remote fails open. PR #125, head `759c9af`, draft, HIGH (protected path `.agents/dev.openhands/hooks/**`) -> not merged.
- Verified: reproduced the false positive first (temp repo with `main` as remote default: pushed feature branch denied "1 commit(s) not pushed"); after the fix the same case allows.
- Verified: `tests/hooks_test.sh` "TOTAL: 179 passed, 0 failed" (was 175; +4 new cases: unpushed feature denies, pushed feature allows, never-pushed denies, unreachable remote allows).
- Verified: `scripts/validate.py` exit 0 ("skills: 33  sub-agents: 19  hooks: 3  OK"); `scripts/loader_smoke.py` exit 0 ("loaded plugin: account-library 1.0.0 / skills: 33  sub-agents: 19  hooks: True / OK") after `pip install openhands-sdk`.
- Verified: `bash -n` on both changed files OK; `git diff --check` clean.
- Open PRs after this run: #125 (BL-5, HIGH, draft), #42 (HIGH, unchanged since 2026-10-31), plus this status PR.
- No schedule claim: a written cron is not a scheduler; sessions cannot self-schedule.

Last 5 actions:
- run (eighty-fourth): merged pending LOW-risk status PR #123; worked BL-5 -> PR #125 (HIGH, draft, not merged); all three gates ran here; opened this status PR.
- idle run (eighty-third): merged pending LOW-risk status PR #122 under the grant (marked ready first); no new inbox seq (seq 3 acked), no `status=ready` item; ran all three gates here; opened status PR #123 (merged).
- idle run (eighty-second): merged pending LOW-risk status PR #121 under the grant (marked ready first); no new inbox seq (seq 3 acked), no `status=ready` item; ran all three gates here; opened status PR #122 (merged).
- idle run (eighty-first): merged pending LOW-risk status PR #120 under the grant (marked ready first); no new inbox seq (seq 3 acked), no `status=ready` item; ran all three gates here; opened status PR #121 (merged).
Next: none queued. BL-1..BL-5 done (BL-5 PR #125 open, HIGH, not merged). Two HIGH-risk PRs await the owner: #42 (watchdog) and #125 (quality-gate fix). Awaiting a new inbox seq or a new `ready` item.
